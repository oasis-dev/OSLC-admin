This document defines the project's community governance per [OASIS Open Projects Governance Policy](https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/documentation/blob/master/policy/project-governance.md).

## Overview

**OSLC**, an OASIS Open Project, is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community that creates next-generation APIs for cloud computing. The community is governed by this document and in accordance with [OASIS Open Project Rules](../board-docs/open-projects-rules.md) with the goal of defining how community should work together to achieve this goal.

## Code Repositories
