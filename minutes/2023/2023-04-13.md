## Minutes

### Link Discovery Managment Discussion

Eran and Martin had a number of questions.
How are predicates represented?

Predicates are just URIs, and should used typicaly URI syntax, e.g., `<https://open-services.net/ns/cm#implementsRequirement>` or oslc_cm:implementsRequirement

LDM servers could manage links between versioned and/or unversioned resources.

What happens when a Configuration-Context is not specified?

If either the target resource for which the client is requesting incoming links, or the potential source resources of those incoming links are versioned resources, then a Configuration-Context must be specified. 


## Action items



- [ ] Jim (or Jad?) to publish NS files - with help of Andrew. Config Management PSD01 was published, but not TRS? Andrew says PSD01 files were published for TRS 
- [ ] Jim to publish NS files for PS01 Config and TRS, not wait until OS. COS is not really a published stage, just a milestone 

- [ ] Jim will check the release tags, at least the latest revision is tagged.
