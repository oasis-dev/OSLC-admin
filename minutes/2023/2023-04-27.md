## Minutes

### Change Management Errata

Request FMV to certify the changes are not substantive scheduled for tomorrow.
Jim to generate a new zip file with updated OASIS icon and publish date.

### Linking Profiles

Ralph waiting for approval to sign the OASIS CLA.

### Link Discovery Management

Discussion on POST entity request body and entry response body.

### Eclipse Lyo

Points to discuss:

1. Whatâ€™s our strategy with the many sites we have on OSLC/Lyo? 
 * www.eclipse.org/lyo - original eclipse project wiki pages, 
 * https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lyo - 
 * https://oslc.github.io/developing-oslc-applications/ - contains OSLC Developer Guide, and documentation of sample applications, Lyo Designer documentation, etc. 
 * https://open-services.net - home site for OSLC-OP open project
 * https://github.com/oslc-op/refimpl - pure implementation of RM, CM, QM, and AM servers
 
 Eclipse is migrating to GitHub wiki pages. So the first two links will need to be migrated somewhere. 
 Most wiki page have already been migrated to OSLC Developer Guide. Jad will deal with that.

 
 In OSLC-OP Scope (content managed under https://github.com/oslc-op)
 1. OSLC-OP standards - in GitHub and use the GitHub wiki for collaboration on developing and maintaining the OASIS standards, publication is managed by OASIS
 2. OSLC Reference implementations - https://github.com/oslc-op/refimpl
 3. open-services.net - the home page for OSLC-OP

In OSLC Scope (content managed under https://github.com/oslc)
 1. OSLC Developer Guide - contains documentation for many OSLC sample applications and guidance on implementing OSLC applications (content that ends up as https://oslc.github.io/developing-oslc-applications/)
 2. Many other projects.

We conclude that we keep the content on OSLC-OP and OSLC github organisations separately. The former relates to content that needs to be governed by OASIS.

We also conclude that we should keep using https://oslc.github.io/developing-oslc-applications for any developer-related content (for example, instructions on how to use a Python library, even if that library's source code resides somewhere else.)

## Action items



- [ ] Jim (or Jad?) to publish NS files - with help of Andrew. Config Management PSD01 was published, but not TRS? Andrew says PSD01 files were published for TRS 
- [ ] Jim to publish NS files for PS01 Config and TRS, not wait until OS. COS is not really a published stage, just a milestone 

- [ ] Jim will check the release tags, at least the latest revision is tagged.
