## Agenda

- [ ] Roll call
- [ ] Start video 
- [ ] Minutes of the last meeting - any matters arising
	https://github.com/oslc-op/oasis-open-project/blob/master/minutes/2023/2023-02-01_OSLC_Product_WG.md
- [ ] Additional perspectives on representing PLM resource using OSLC < OEM input from Martin Ulrich Bosch
	A presentation was provided
- [ ] Discussion & summary on OEM input
	Notes below
- [ ] Plans for next meeting - OEM & other inputs
	Reminder following the majority verdict on the recent doodle poll we have shifted to Monday's 
	the next meeting is Monday 27th Feb 9ET, 15CET
		Continue with Bosch input, pursue input from other OEMs, commentary on EuroSTEP input from Judith Crockford
- [ ] Any other business
		There was significant disruption from web conference troubles - a suggestion was that noise was transferring mute/unmute rights away from the speaker - next time we could try to be on mute unless we specifically have a question during the speaker session
- [ ] Any closing comments from attendees

## Minutes

Martin Ulrich of Bosch
1. Taking a company capabilities view of Product & Engineering Management
2. ASPICE is a key basis for "capmap"
3. Product Identification Management - and work products to describe the products
4. CI Control track maturity plus srequiretatus
5. In Eng Management - critical cross-cutting with ASPICE traceability across V model requires 2 way linking 
6. Consistency management triple consistent with meaning < 
Q&A: Need to identify PVe PVa are these part of PCM ? and need that in EM ? yes these are interlated - what data and stakeholder viewpoints mixed
7. Need: Component as an abstract product concepts at different levels
8. Need: To instantion of a product of a component or series
9. Config is a Work product 
Q&A Config is a tangible Work Product internally ? (organisation of work (products))
10. OSLC Contribution = CI > related to a versioned artefact(set of)
11. Need: to version control the CI (container) hierarchy < key difference
Q&A: "product as engineered" is this the eBOM - version independent - Configuration is the versioned set
12. ACTION: Short write up per term ?
13. P4 CPO extract - GCM at the PDM level, BOM is more of ERP type. 100 tools 300 work products
14. Mechanical BOM is a document structure today "drawing" aim for a model
15. Need: to create a relationship between Req and Product structure at an appropriate level - is it the PDM system ? and how select the functional area of a CAD model. Mechanical Master is  
16. Need: Create associations between Product and Project and FMEA
17. Need for cfgM: page provided
18. Scenarios: by topic - PMD, Cfg data, Link Index
19. Need PMD Components is a product, PL or project specialisation
20. Need: how to inherit attributes from Component - indetification, calssification, org responsibiliy, taregt customer
21: Need: similar for cfg data
22. Need: Link Index "trillion link" - distrbuted
23. Need: Classification management NOTE: SKOS could be a candidate https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/
23. Need: PLE manage features, feature model and variation points
